# Undo Blunder

Goal: a tool which pulls chess game data from various sites (chess.com, lichess, etc.) then determines how you can improve on your chess. It recommends areas of focus. For example, it could suggest:
 
* Which openings to play, and which not to play 
* Which move branches you have the most trouble on (ie where to focus)
* Which concepts you most miss? (Fork, skewr, battery, backrank, etc. etc.)
* Analysis of other chess games of similar level to find which concepts you would need ot get better at. Perhaps find trends for which concepts the level above you have improved on?

Basic steps:

- [ ] pull data from various different websites
- [ ] analyze data and glean insights
- [ ] collect and store data for bulk analysis (also do other random games, players)
- [ ] show end user recommendations
- [ ] section to show which move orders are well played, which are not, and shich moves you can improve on the most. It should also provide recommendations on what to play next in that scenario. 
- [ ] section which shows which type of bluders you most make and resources to learn how not to maek those (puzzles, tutorials, etc.)


Notes:

* Maybe some AI/machine learning algorithms be implemnted? Or all this shoudl be h and written?
